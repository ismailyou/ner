Named entity recognition is the first task of identifying the words which may represnt the who, what and whom in the text. It helps in identifying the major entities the text is talking about

## THE PLAN :

1.   What does NER mean ?
2.   How NER works ?
3.   Why it is important?
3.   Named Entity Recognition use cases
4.   Load Dependencies
5.   Load Corpus
6.   Basic Named Entity (NE) tagging using NLTK
    - Word Based
    - Sentence Based
7.   More powerful package
    - Stanford NLP NER
    - Spacy
